A simple exercise using these data would be to plot, for example, Period vs. Period Derivative, which is a very common plot made by pulsar astronomers (typically, period is on the horizontal axis, and period derivative is on the vertical axis, and period derivative is plotted in logarithm).

I'd like to see, if possible, a dynamic and/or interctive web data visualization example.  This could be done using javascript tools such as D3.js, or bokeh, for example.

Examples of dynamic plot visualization could be one or more of the following:
- mouse hovering revealing data for each data point;
- plot zooming in and out with dynamic axis labelling;
- additiona and/or removal of data by user, with automated plot scale adjustment;
- many other possibilities.  Be creative!

We have supplied a small data test in two forms: comma-separated values (pulsar_data_test.csv) and JSON (pulsar_data_test.json). The two files contain exactly the same data, so it will be up to you to decide which you prefer to work with for now.  The columns in the text file we supply correspond to the following parameters (which are shown at the top of the file, and could be used to label the data):

(1) Pulsar:  this is the pulsar's name
(2) TOAs: the number of "times-of-arrival" we have for the pulsar (these are pulsar timing data points)
(3) Raw Profiles: the number of raw data files we have for the pulsar
(4) Period: The pulsar's rotation period, in units of seconds [s]
(5) Period Derivative: The pulsar's spin-down rate, in units of seconds/seconds [s/s]
(6) DM: The pulsar's dispersion measure, in units of parsecs/cubic centimetre [pc/cc]
(7) RMS: The root-mean-square value of the pulsar's timing residuals, in usints of microseconds [us]
(8) Binary: States whether pulsar is in a binary system.  Y for yes, "-" for no.
